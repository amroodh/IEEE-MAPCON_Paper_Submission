## Abstract
his paper investigates the design and performance of non-conventional dielectric dome antennas integrated with a 4x4 Microstrip Patch Antenna Array (MPAA). The primary objective is to enhance the wide-angle scanning capabilities of the antenna for modern communication and radar systems. Three distinct dome designs were analyzed: Design 1 and Design 2 prioritizing the maximization of scanning range, and Design 3 focusing on minimizing dome size and gain drop at boresight angles. The results indicate substantial improvements in beam shaping and scanning capabilities with the incorporation of dielectric domes. While the scanning ability of MPAA is limited to 45 degrees, all three dome designs significantly enhanced the scanning range and maintained acceptable gain levels. Notably, Design 2 achieved a Scanning range of upto 70 degrees and Design 3 showed 1 dB increase in boresight gain compared to other two domes.
